Removing noise from scanned pages is a important step before their submission to the optical character recognition **OCR**. 

Here, I developed an unsupervised deep learning model that can effectively remove multiple types of noise, including salt & pepper noise, blurred and/or faded text in order to demonstrate that the proposed model improves the quality of scanned images.
